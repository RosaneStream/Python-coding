3. **User Interaction**: Gain experience in handling user input, validating responses, and navigating through a menu-driven interface.

4. **Error Handling and Validation**: Practice input validation and error handling techniques to provide informative feedback to users.

5. **Modularity and Code Organization**: Explore the benefits of modular programming by organizing code into reusable functions and structuring the application logic around a main function.
